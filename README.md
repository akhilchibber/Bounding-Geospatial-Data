Welcome to the Geospatial Shapefile Processing Toolkit! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts, each designed to perform a specific type of processing on polygon shapefiles. Whether you're looking to extract geometrical shapes, analyze spatial boundaries, or transform data, these scripts provide a range of functionalities to suit your needs.

## Scripts Overview

1. **Delaunay Triangulation (TRIANGULATION.py)**: Generates a Delaunay Triangulation from a given polygon shapefile, useful for spatial analysis and triangulating points in a plane.

2. **Rotational Bounding Box (RO_BBOX.py)**: Calculates the rotational bounding box for a given polygon shapefile, which can be used in spatial data visualization and analysis.

3. **Convex Hull Extraction (CONVEX_HULL.py)**: Creates the Convex Hull of a polygon shapefile. This is helpful in understanding the outer boundary of a shape or dataset.

4. **Concave Hull Extraction (CONCAVE_HULL.py)**: Extracts the Concave Hull from a polygon shapefile, offering a tighter fitting boundary than the convex hull for irregular shapes.

5. **Circle Extraction (CIRCLE.py)**: Determines the smallest enclosing circle for a given polygon shapefile, useful in various geometrical computations.

6. **Bezier Envelope (BEZIER_ENVELOPE.py)**: Generates a Bezier Envelope from a polygon shapefile, which can be used for advanced geometrical representations and analyses.

7. **Bounding Box (BBOX.py)**: Extracts the standard bounding box of a polygon shapefile, essential for many spatial analysis tasks.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts, you'll need Python installed on your system along with libraries such as `geopandas`, `shapely`, `scipy`, `numpy`, and others specific to each script.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `geopandas`, `shapely`, `scipy.spatial`, `numpy`, `alphashape`, `smallestenclosingcircle`, etc.

### Running the Scripts

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the desired script with the appropriate shapefile as input.
