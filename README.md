# Bounding Geospatial Data: Different Approaches andÂ Methods

We'll explore a variety of techniques for defining boundaries around a set of geospatial points, lines, or polygons. Bounding a dataset is like drawing an invisible fence around the data, enabling efficient searching, querying, and processing. We will delve into few distinct bounding methods, exploring their characteristics. Our objective is to help select the optimal bounding method for our specific use case.
